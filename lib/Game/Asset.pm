=head1 NAME

  Game::Asset - Load assets (images, music, etc.) for games

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $asset = Game::Asset->new({
        file => 't_data/test1.zip',
    });
    my $foo = $asset->get_by_name( 'foo' );
    my $name = $foo->name;
    my $type = $foo->type;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A common way to handle game assets is to load them in one big zip file. It 
might end up named with extensions like ".wad" or ".pk3" or even ".jar", but 
it's a zip file.

This module allows you to load up these files and fetch their contents into 
Perl objects. Each type of file is represented by a class that does the 
L<Game::Asset::Type> Moose role. Which type class, exactly, is determined with 
mappings defined in the C<index.yml> file. There are also a few built-in 
mappings.

=head1 THE INDEX FILE

A file named C<index.yml> (a L<YAML> file) is required inside the zip file, 
and resolves to a hash. Keys are the file extensions (without the dot), and 
values are the Perl class that will handle that type. That class must do 
the L<Game::Asset::Type> Moose role.

The file must exist. If you just want to use the built-in mappings, it can 
resolve to an empty hash.

=head2 Built-in Mappings

The following mappings are always available without being in the index file:

=over 4

=item * txt -- L<Game::Asset::PlainText>

=item * yml -- L<Game::Asset::YAML>

=item * pm -- L<Game::Asset::PerlModule>

=back

=head2 Multi-mappings

There are times when the given content should be processed by more than one 
mapping. For instance, a game may want to process a L<Graphics::GVG> vector 
in both OpenGL and Chipmunk (physics library).

This is what multi-mappings are for. See L<Game::Asset::Multi> for details.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 file

The path to the zip file.

=head2 mappings

A hashref (with autoderef). The keys are the file extensions, and the values 
are the L<Game::Asset::Type> classes that will handle that type.

=head2 entries

A list of all the assets with their file extensions removed. Note that the 
C<index.yml> file is filtered out.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 get_by_name

  $asset->get_by_name( 'foo' );

Pass in a name of an asset (without the extension). Returns an object 
representing the data in the zip file.

Any other arguments passed will be passed to the handling class.
