=head1 NAME

  Game::Asset::Type - Role for asset types

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Each file in the asset archive is represented by a class that does this role. 
Types are determined by L<Game::Asset> using the file extension.

=head1 PROVIDES

=head2 process_content

This is called with the full data. If it's the first time the data was passed, 
then it calls C<_process_content()> and sets C<has_been_processed()> to true.

=head2 name

The short name (without extension) of the asset.

=head2 full_name

The full name (with extension) of the asset.

=head2 has_been_processed

Boolean. If true, then the asset data has already been passed once to 
C<process_content()>.

=head2 _orig_content

The C<_process_content()> method should set this to the original, untouched 
data passed in.

=head1 REQUIRES

=head2 type

Returns the name of the type.

=head2 _process_content

Passed the untouched data so it can be processed.
