=head1 NAME

  Game::Asset::Multi - A mapping type that maps to multiple other types

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A game asset may want to be processed in multiple ways. For example, a 
L<Graphics::GVG> vector may want both OpenGL and Chipmunk (physics library) 
representations.

This role should be done by any type that wishes to process a single piece of 
content into multiple sub-types. The C<_process_content()> for the multitype 
should pass the content along to each of the sub-types.

See L<Game::Asset::MultiExample> for example code.

This role does L<Game::Asset::Type>.
